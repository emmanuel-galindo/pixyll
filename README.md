# Pixyll fork for emmanuel-galindo.github.io (CodeBites blog)

The fork holds specific changes to build the personal site emmanuel-galindo.github.io. 
To be honest, it would have been enough to use it through a GitHub pages generator (ex: TinyPress.co), but as GitHub obviously controls the plugins you could use I shortly 
found myself needing to paginate categories, in order to provide an specific sections for blog posts in my native language, and therefore I had to build the jekyll site
in my local environment to then just publish the _site result.
This at the end provided me many other goodies from the Template.

If you happen to need a paginator for categories, that compiles in Jekyll 3, I encourage you to try my take on this (it was a fork on another project though, please give them 
love as well): [jekyll-category-pagination](https://github.com/emmanuel-galindo/jekyll-category-pagination).
